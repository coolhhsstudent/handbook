# Basic Guidelines

1. Normal procedures at Haverhill High School involve teachers, parents, administrators and other staff members.
2. All staff members are encouraged and expected to resolve minor conflicts and minor violations of rules when and where they occur.
3. Except for trivial incidents, parents are to be informed of violations as soon as possible.
4. Parents are to be informed as soon as a pattern of inappropriate behavior occurs.
5. All applicable procedures and school rules are in force off school grounds during school sponsored activities.
6. Each school adult is responsible for bringing misconduct to the attention of students and, if appropriate, parents/guardians. If a conference alone does not or will not resolve the issue, a disciplinary referral will be made.
